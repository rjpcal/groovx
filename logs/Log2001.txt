(9-Dec-2000, done 17-May-2001) IoDb does not need to be an IoObject
anymore; instead, it should provide functionality for reading+writing
object archives. The IoDb package should not have
stringify/destringify or read/write.

| (4-Dec-2000, done 18-May-2001) Need to prevent resource leaks by
| making newIO() return a PtrHandle<IO::IoObject>. This will require
| Reader::readObject() to return a PtrHandle as well, and require Reader
| implementations to use PtrHandle's internally. Hmmm... need to make
| real sure that there is no way to create more than one PtrHandle for a
| given IoObject... oops, duh! I already have avoided this problem by
| making RefCount a base class of IoObject, so we can actually make
| multiple PtrHandle's without a problem. The way to get at this is to
| change the static make() functions to return a PtrHandle. Then
| CreatorFromFunc will store the appropriate type of function pointer,
| and its create() method will return a PtrHandle<Base>. The main
| drawback here is that we greatly increase the dependence on
| PtrHandle... Then again, this is probably a good thing, as it reduces
| the use of raw pointers.
| 
| (done) change users of newIO() and make() to instantiate a PtrHandle
| rather than a raw pointer
| 
| (done) newIO() to return a PtrHandle
| 
| (done) change Factory to return IdItem's

(19-Jan-2000, done 18-May-2001) GLBitmap should use auto_ptr for
itsRenderer and fix initialization order (eliminate
tempRenderer). Same for XBitmap.

(8-Jul-1999, done 18-May-2001) Idea: have TclCmd's be able to return
doc strings; then TclCmd or TclPkg would store a list of all
registered commands, so that a special help command (like '?')
followed by a command name could return its help string. This would be
nice since the various intermediate command classes could provide
default doc-strings. Subclasses could either append, or override,
their superclass's doc-string.

(19-May-2001, done 19-May-2001) IoProxy should still store its
referand's as IdItem's. IdItem's no longer need to do IoDb insertion.

(16-May-2001, done 19-May-2001) Don't need IoMap; instead, IoObject's
should just insert themselves into the IoDb automatically upon
construction. Hmmm... the problem here is that this won't work for
IoObject's that are constructed on the stack (such as IoProxy's). So
do we somehow forbid any subclasses from being instantiated on the
stack? Or just give up on automatic IoDb insertion? And the answer
is... we can prohibit IoObject's from being instantiated on the stack
at runtime, by Assert'ing in RefCounted's destructor that the
ref-counts are zero. And we can allow subclasses (such as IoProxy) to
choose not to be automatically inserted in the IoDb, by the addition
of a "doInsert" argument to the IoObject constructor that defaults to
true.
