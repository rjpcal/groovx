This project is an experimental application framework for designing
visual psychological experiments. It is based on a model that
includes, experiments, blocks, trials, graphic objects, timing
handlers, and response handlers. The framework is written in C++, but
most componenets are scriptable in Tcl.  A new C++ API wraps around
the Tcl C API to make it easy to add scriptability to new components.

Rather than using preprocessing or macros to expose C++ classes to
Tcl, I have tried to stay within the C++ language, using templates and
inheritance to provide the meta-class information to Tcl, with very
little additional code being required of client classes in order to
provide this meta-level access.

Here are a few starting points into the framework:

<ul>
<li>Util::RefCounted and Util::RefCounts
<li>Util::Object
<li>Util::Ref and Util::SoftRef
<li>ObjDb

<li>Tcl::Convert
<li>Tcl::Command
<li>Tcl::Context

<li>Tcl::Pkg

<li>Field and Value 

</ul>
