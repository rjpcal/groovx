(19-Jul-1999, nix) Eureka! The right way to build various experiments
is now suddenly clear (!) There must be an abstract base class
ExptBuilder that will have pretty much one function, build() (but how
does it get the params that it needs?). This abstract class can have a
Tcl interface associated with it. Subclasses will know how to build
specific types of experiments, such as triads expt's, pairs exp'ts,
facefinder expt's, etc. In particular, one subclass could do all its
work in Tcl by just taking a Tcl script as its constructor argument,
and Tcl_Eval'ing that script in its build() function. This class would
still allow great flexibility in expt-building since Tcl build scripts
could be changed without recompiling; however the framework allows
more stablebuild scripts to be migrated to their own subclasses on the
C++-side. But wait... what advantage is there to having all this stuff
in virtual functions? i.e., where is the client that will benefit by
not having to know the concrete class of some ExptBuilder?

(18-Oct-1999, done) How to handle base classes in the Reader/Writer
interface? We can can just call Base::readFrom() or Base::writeTo(),
which will generally work, unless a base class and subclass happen to
share private data members with the same name. Perhaps we could avoid
this by giving a fully scoped attribute name (i.e. 'Face::noseLength')
when storing or retrieving attributes. The disadvantage of this is
that it is only a convention, and as such it could be ignored on
purpose or by oversight. [Later] Now I have a readBaseClass() and
writeBaseClass() that are able to handle a base class's attributes
inline, inside a nested {} pair.

(19-Oct-1999, done) Just realized how testing should work for
base-class functionality... the base class test package should provide
a way to run all of the base class tests on a particular subclass. In
Tcl, this should just be a matter of providing the subclass name to a
proc, for example 'IO::testSubClass FixPt'. This can eliminate a lot
of duplicated script code, and allows all subclasses to benefit when
new base class tests are written. OK, I just realized also that it
would make sense to put the test procedures for a class inside that
class's Tcl namespace... this can be wholly at the script-level
without having to add any C code.

(5-Nov-1999, done) AsciiStreamReader should gracefully report an invalid
attribute name, perhaps by throwing a NoSuchAttributeError.

(30-Nov-1999, done 7-Jan-2000) What to do about 'control reaching end
of non-void function' in ExptDriver::Impl::block(), responseHdlr(),
and timingHdlr()? Probably the best is to eliminate the error checking
in block(), responseHdlr(), and timingHdlr(), and require that the
id's be checked with assertIds() before these functions are called. We
can add an Assert to this effect inside block(), etc. Done.

(6-Dec-1999, done) Replace GrObj::getScreenFromWorld etc. with
Canvas::... in BitmapRep (how to get the Canvas& arguments where they
need to be?)

(11-Jan-2000, done 11-Jan-2000) Need to have quick Tcl access to the
current trial id. Probably an Expt::currentTrial command for Tcl.

(14-Jan-2000, done 14-Jan-2000) There is some weird problem with
TlistWidget, perhaps?  Ah yes... first, we didn't initialize
itsCurTrial and itsVisibility in the constructor, and second of all,
we didn't check for itsVisibility in safeDrawTrial() before attempting
to draw.

(14-Jan-2000, done 14-Jan-2000) Need to flesh out the Pipe class that
has been introduced in Bitmap::loadPbmGzCmd(). OK, this is done so now
the Pipe class itself provides access to an fstream& that can be used
to read/write from the Pipe as appropriate.

(6-Dec-1999, done 16-Jan-2000) Do we also want Canvas& arguments in
the bounding box call chain? I added a Canvas& argument to
GrObj::getBoundingBox(), but not to the protected
GrObj::grGetBoundingBox()... the only subclass that needed a Canvas in
order to implement this function was Bitmap(Rep), so for this
implementation I just retrieve the Canvas from the
Application->Experiment->Canvas call chain. Thus GLCanvas::theCanvas()
is eliminated.

(20-Sep-1999, done 19-Jan-2000) Fixed a nasty memory corruption bug
that was due to neglecting to set GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT appropriately
before reading pixel data out of the screenbuffer into main
memory. Since the value for GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT defaults to 4, it is not
sufficient to allocate (width*height) bytes if the row size is not
divisible by 4. How to avoid these problems in the future? Include a
byteAlignment member in Bitmap, add a utility function that
reallocates appropriate space for a given width and height. [Later]
OK, this is handled centrally by Gfx::BmapData.

(11-Jan-2000, done 20-Jan-2000) Need a way to defer loading of pbm
files from when Bitmap's are deserialized until when they are first
used. This would require a way to for the files to be loaded on
demand. It would have the added benefit that in an fMRI script, we
would only have to load the bitmaps that are actually used in the
experiment. Done using BmapData to handle the actuall caching process.

(8-Feb-2000, done 8-Feb-2000) Should think about doing dynamic tracing
generically, perhaps with a mixin base class. This is basically done
by using Util::Tracer.

(27-Jun-1999, done 13-Mar-2000) Maybe Response's want to be first
class objects rather than lowly int's? This would allow the class to
have a static member InvalidResponse... would allow subclassing of
responses... would allow different ResponseHandler's to work with
different Response subclasses... Interestingly, the creation of a
Response requires input from both ResponseHandler (for the semantic
value) and from the TimingHandler (for the response time) --> trying
to implement Response would probably raise some important design
issues. Actually, I think I do have a simple Response struct that is
just local to Trial's right now.

(3-Mar-2000, done 20-Mar-2000) Ugh. I just now realized how much time
it takes to compile STL headers. In the past, I didn't try to
forward-declare STL templates since their declarations can vary by
compiler... but I now realized (duh!) that (by using an extra level of
indirection) I can use a "stringfwd.h" file that correctly declares
string, depending on the compiler. On a tiny test file, this reduces
the compilation time from about 15 sec to only 1-2 sec !!! So I've
created "stringfwd.h" and "vectorfwd.h", and I'm going to try to use
these exclusively when a declaration is needed in one of my header
files. One issue is that of default arguments... these cannot be used
unless the full class definition is known. This particularly affects
uses like 'const string& s = ""', but I think the problem can be
easily circumvented by removing the default argument, and adding
instead an overloaded function version with no string
argument. [8-Mar-2000] Well, now, a week later, the compile time for a
full debug build of the project has been cut nearly in half, and
"stringfwd.h" is no longer needed at all!  I've found that most
interfaces can use 'const char*' just fine, and let clients and
implementors deal with more complex string classes if they so
choose. Only 12 translation units now depend on <string>, and 21 on
<vector>. [20-Mar-2000] Decreased those numbers even more now... only
5 translation units depend on <vector>, 9 on <string>, 3 on <map>, 1
on <list>, and 1 on <set>.

(21-Mar-2000, done 22-Mar-2000) We need some sort of versioning
facility for Reader/Writer. OK, but how do we handle versioning
separately for base classes? Right now, base classes are handled ad
hoc, with subclasses calling their superclass's writeTo() method from
within their own writeTo() method. OK, I've added readBaseClass() and
writeBaseClass() methods to Reader and Writer. This allows base
classes to be written inline, with a bracketed block of the base
class's attributes treated as a single attribute for its containing
class. (In principle, we could now handle owned/contained objects in
this same way). In order to correctly write base classes, we first
needed some way to pass the base part of an object as an IO* while
ensuring that the correct overrides of readFrom()/writeTo() would be
called (i.e. avoid calling the most fully derived version of these
functions). This can be done with the IOProxy template, which holds a
pointer to an object of class C, and forwards all IO functions to the
C:: versions of those functions. So we can pass an IOProxy<Base>* to
the readBaseClass() and writeBaseClass() functions in order to achieve
the desired effect. Another structural change was to allow
AsciiStreamReader to maintain a stack of attribute maps, so that we
can represent arbitrarily deep nesting hierarchies of objects. This
involved just changing itsAttribs from an AttribMap to a
slink_list<AttribMap>. Finally, we needed to allow the string enders
('^') that occur inside a base class's attribute to be ignored when
the end class's attributes are being read... to do this we introduce
the convention that {}'s protect ^'s, so in order to have reached the
end of an attribute, we must see a '^' and be at brace level 0. This
in turn required that {}'s be treated specially--they must be escaped
with '\' when occurring within an attribute string. 

(6-Oct-1999, done 23-Mar-2000) GrObj needs a saveBitmapCache()
function to dump a cached bitmap to file. Or maybe just a
writeBitmap() function, that would apply even for objects whose mode
is not one of the bitmap cache modes, and that would generate a
temporary bitmap if necessary. [Later] This stuff belongs outside of
the GrObj class, since it needs only the public interface... perhaps
it should just go in grobjtcl.cc file.

(28-Mar-2000, done 29-Mar-2000) Need to implement SerialRh (response
handler). This will share a lot of code with EventResponseHdlr, so we
probably need to create a base class for both such as FeedbackRh that
will handle the inputResponseMap and the feedbackMap but will delegate
attend() and ignore() via abstract functions. ... [Later] OK, so in
fact we don't need a new ResponseHandler class; instead we can add a
new event source that translates incoming serial port characters into
window-system events via Tk_QueueWindowEvent.


========================================================================
| GOAL -- done 11 May 2000
| 
| Goal: ExptDriver should not have to know anything about TimingHdlr's
| or ResponseHdlr's. Done!
| 
| To do this, as usual we should try an easy migration path.
| 1) make Trial an abstract class, and move current Trial implementation
| into a derived class
| 2) set up abstract Trial functions to take on behavior of Experiment
| functions. At first, ExptDriver can just forward stuff to Trial so
| that we don't have to redefine the handlers' interfaces right away.
| 
| (24-Jan-2000) More flexible behavior by putting trial behavior in
| Trial rather than in ExptDriver.
| 
| (9-May-2000) I think I may finally have my hooks into this
| problem. Branched off behavior from edBeginTrial() into
| edDoTrial(). Added Trial::trDoTrial(), which is called from
| edBeginTrial(). For now, trDoTrial() just calls right back to
| edDoTrial(), mimicking the previous behavior exactly. But... now we
| can slowly migrate the behavior from edDoTrial() back into
| trDoTrial(). Then this process can be iterated for the other
| Experiment:: functions. Eventually this will allow us to create a
| Trial base class with these new functions as virtual functions, so
| that we can create Trial's with very different behaviors (e.g. a
| ball-tracking trial, or a delayed-match trial).
| 
| (12-May-2000) The way things look now, there is fairly clean
| separation amongst the different experiment participants. Basically:
| 
|                                 ___________________________________
|                                |                                   |
|                                V                                   |
|  Experiment ---> Block ---> Trial ---> Response     Timing       Trial
|             <---       <---       <--- Handler   +->Handler ---> Event
|                                |                 |                 
|                                |_________________|
| 
| Importantly, this means that we can treat ResponseHandler, TimingHdlr,
| and TrialEvents as implementation details of Trial... so that can now
| substitute in other Trial subclasses with different behaviors.
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(15-Jan-2000, done) I think the executable shouldn't have to depend on
the shared libraries, since these should be able to be change without
forcing a relink on the main executable. ... Yes, but we need to be
able to account for whether static or dynamic linking is being used.


(16-Dec-1999, done) Try to fix ToglConfig::loadFonti on irix by
switching fontnumber to a long before casting to char*. Tried
it... didn't work.

(done 19-Sep-2000) Want an indirection for auxiliary files so that the
complete pathname is not hard-coded. To do this kind of added
indirection (e.g. for now-hard-coded sound files, etc.), we can
require an environment variable like GRSH_LIB_DIR to point to the root
of a directory tree that will hold all auxiliary files for grsh
programs. This can include the current contents of face/faces_triads,
and face/audio, plus probably some other new goodies.

(note 22-Sep-2000) Looks like I now have a new architecture to target:
irix6 w/ MIPSpro compiler. The MIPSpro compiler looks to be fairly
C++-standard compliant. It would be nice to have a separate build for
that compiler... might be faster, also might allow c++ exceptions in
shared libraries. But, this is something to try only after I get
everything compiling cleanly with g++ again (following the upgrade to
irix6.5 from irix6.3).

(done 23-Sep-2000) OK, I figured out from a post on DejaNews that the
problem on the sgi is that sgi's libGLU was implemented partially in
c++ and compiled with MIPSpro; due to incompatible ABI's, this code
cannot be linked with code compiled by g++. So, I have two options: 1)
compile a version of OpenGL using g++, or 2) figure out how to get
MIPSpro to compile my code. For option 2), I guess I can just use
reinterpret_cast (which I'll define as SGI_IDIOT_CAST)... and keep my
fingers crossed. ... OK, now I've done five hours of porting so that
everything compiles/links/runs ok on curie using MIPSpro. I have a few
bugs to wrinkle out however. And, this effort has provided an impetus
for becoming more standard-compliant, with regard to the 'std'
namespace, and the new IOStreams library.

(done 23-Sep-2000) Bug on the new irix build of grsh--the application
crashes on exit (something in EventResponseHandler::ignore()). OK,
this is due to the fact that ignore() tries to use itsWidget, but the
ToglConfig has already been destroyed by the time we try to use
it. This is fixed by adding forgetWidget() and forgetTrial(), which
set the pointers to null at the end of a trial or when the experiment
is halted.

(done 24-Sep-2000) Hey... something good came out of this whole sgi mess:
now I can use shared libraries on the sgi, since MIPSpro allows
exceptions to work correctly with shared libraries.

(23-Sep-2000, done 24-Sep-2000) Bugs on the new irix build of grsh:
togl widget won't run in rgba mode. ... OK, this was due to the hack
that I had set up to force colormaps to be set, in which the colormap
was set recursively up the window parent chain. But, trying to set a
colormap on an rgba window makes no sense, and this is what was
causing the BadMatch error. In any case, that hack is not needed in
rgba mode, so I added a check for the widget's itsRgbaFlag before we
start setting colormaps.

(nix 24-Sep-2000) make startup procedures figure out if X server is
available

(done 25-Sep-2000) Added a miscellaneous "log" string property to
ExptDriver, so that we can append human-readable messages to it as
needed.

========================================================================
| GOAL -- done 29-Sep-2000
|   Refactoring the legacy IO interface (serialize/deserialize)
|
| (29-Sep-2000) This is done enough for now. I now have a LegacyReader and
| LegacyWriter that have an augmented interface that allows client
| classes to emulate the format of their old serialize/deserialize
| functions within the readFrom/writeTo context. It's a bit clunky, but
| I think it's much better than before, and there is still room for more
| streamlining if it becomes important in the future.
| 
| (16-May-2000) Phase out the old serialize()/deserialize() interface.
| 
| (25-Sep-2000) The main obstacle here is that loadFaces() and
| loadObjects() rely on the old interface. These will continue to be
| needed for some time, in order to read older files. But, this only
| requires the old interface for the GrObj hierarchy. In fact, we only
| need Face, MorphyFace, and Fish. Plus, we need to arrange a new way to
| store object databases that works with the new IO interface.
| 
| Basically we need an Adapter class that can be used to implement the
| old IO interface using the functionality defined by the new
| interface. This would work by trapping all calls to
| serialize/deserialize in the IoObject base class. This class would
| then construct an appropriate adapter, and call readFrom or writeTo
| using this adapter.
| 
| The problem that we face is that in the new IO interface, the
| Reader/Writer does the parsing, but in the old IO interface, the
| individual classes do the parsing, and they don't always do it the
| same way. Maybe I have a plan for a big refactoring job:
| 
| 1-done) rename current serialize/deserialize/charCount to legacySrlz,
|    legacyDesrlz, and legacyCharCount.
| 
| 2-done) Make legacy functions protected, and force callers to call
|    through a new serialize/deserialize interface. For now IoObject
|    just forwards onto the protected functions.
| 
| 3-done) Change parameter list of legacy functions to take a Reader* or
|    Writer*.
| 
| 4-done) Have ioSerialize() and ioDeserialize() pass a LegacyReader* or
|    LegacyWriter* to the legacy functions. These classes will allow
|    access to the stream and the IOFlag. Add downcasts to the
|    implementation of the legacy functions.
| 
| 5-done) Eliminate legacyCharCount(), and replace it with a slow, but
|    generic implementation in ioCharCount().
| 
| 6-done) Eliminate the stream and flag parameters from the legacy functions.
| 
| 7-done) Use writeTypename() rather than checking IO::TYPENAME.
| 
| 8-done) Remove the stream and IOFlag parameters from the legacy functions.
| 
| 9-done) Reimplement the legacy functions in terms of the LegacyReader and
|    LegacyWriter interfaces.
| 
| 	9a-done) Do the easy stuff--the basic types char, int, bool, double.
| 	9b-done) Do the harder stuff--Value types.
| 	9c-done) Let LegacyReader and LegacyWriter handle the typenames
| 	9c-done) Do the harder stuff--sequences.
| 	9d-done) Do the harder stuff--strings.
| 
| 10-done) Ditch unused IoMgr::newIO() functions.
| 
| 11-done) Remove unneeded #include <iostream.h>'s.
| 
| 12-done) Eliminate the ioSerialize wrapper functions, and have former
|    clients just instantiate a LegacyReader/LegacyWriter on their own.
| 
| 13-done) Remove legacySrlz and legacyDesrlz from IoObject. Subclasses
| 	can continue to implement these as private functions, and then
| 	branch into them (if necessary) from writeTo and readFrom based on
| 	a dynamic_cast. This way, classes can keep their legacy code
| 	separate from current code, but clients see only a uniform IO
| 	interface via readFrom() and writeTo().
| 
| 14-done) Remove the now unnecessary dynamic_cast's from legacySrlz() and
| 	legacyDesrlz() implementations.
| 
| 15-done) Remove legacyIoTypename()? I think this might be everywhere the
| 	same as ioTypename().
| 
| 16-done) Add readLegacyVersion() to LegacyReader to handle the '@1' format
| 	used by Face and MorphyFace.
| 
| (13-Apr-2000) Encapsulate the old serialize/deserialize functions by
| wrapping them in a special Reader/Writer pair, that has specialized
| functions for each of the currently existing types. If an unsupported
| type is encountered, we throw an exception. Come to think of it, we'd
| only have to support a Reader, since we don't want to do any writing
| if this format is to become obsolete. This would have the advantage of
| moving all the ugly old code out of the current components.
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(21-Sep-2000, done 2-Oct-2000) Arghh! More event-loop problems. Get a
core dump after Ctrl-C (which halts experiment), followed by Ctrl-Q
(which rehalts, then attempts to write data and quit). This triggers
an assertion itsCanvas != 0 in Trial::getCanvas, called from
Trial::trUndrawTrial(). OK... I'm getting to the bottom of
this. Basically, the first halt triggers Block::abortTrial(), from
Trial::trAbortTrial(), from Trial::trHaltExpt(). This changes the
current trial in the Block. Then, on the next halt, the new current
Trial attempts to trUndraw(), but this fails since the trial has never
been begun, and so itsCanvas == 0. TO SOLVE THIS: I think that
trHaltExpt() doesn't really need to trAbortTrial()... it would be fine
to just leave the current trial as is; when the experiment resumes
we'll start off with the same current trial. But this may miss the
underlying problem... that somehow it is possible to have a "current"
trial in a corrupted state. We could introduce a state flag into the
Trial, so that it ignores all requests until it has been officially
begun. Yes-- this would work. I think the gang-of-four State pattern
would be good here. Have an abstract TrialState class with virtual
functions that match the main trial events. These functions take a
Trial&, and the concrete subclasses take the appropriate action for
that state. The instances of TrialState are themselves stateless (they
have no member data, only behavior), so we can store static instances
of the various states within the TrialState base class. But, maybe we
should work with Block also to ensure that its 'current' trial is not
adjusted until that trial is going to be begun. ... Well, I added an
'itsState' member to Trial::Impl. Right now this is just an enum, and
all of the action functions check for (itsState == INACTIVE) before
doing anything. More elegant would be to have itsState be a pointer to
an implementation of TrialState, so that the (itsState == INACTIVE)
checks would be just handled by virtual function dispatch. However,
that solution is probably overkill right now, although I'll keep it in
mind for the future. But, I still think my solution smells like
defensive programming... I should perhaps still take a look at Block
to see if it can be restructured in a better way so that it doesn't
call action functions on inactive trials.

(nix 2-Oct-2000) Idea for a generic ExptElement interface that would
apply to Experiment, Block, Trial, ResponseHandler, and
TimingHandler. In the pseudo chain-of-command hierarchy that describes
experiment control, this would allow children to know their parents
only as ExperimentElements, while parents would know the specific type
of their children. This would help reduce coupling. In particular,
TrialEvents would only have to know Trial's as ExptElem's in order to
implement callbacks. Maybe this doesn't work... it looks like
ExptElement would be nearly identical to TrialBase.

(done 21-Sep-2000) Got some cool breakpoint-type things working with
Util::Trace. Basically, we can call Util::Trace::setMode() so that we
break into a command-line on trace-in and trace-out. Then this
command-line can either reset the mode to RUN, or continue
stepping. We could easily allow step-in or step-over as well, by
putting a limit on the stack depth for which tracing is allowed.

========================================================================
| GOAL #3  --  done 9-Oct-2000
| 
| Implement reference counting so that smart pointers can be used within
| C++ instead of integer id's.
| 
| 1-done) Add a SharedPtr to PtrList that starts the provides reference
|    counting skeleton.
| 
| 2-done) Add a MasterVoidPtr to VoidPtrList, and turn over the control of
|    object destruction to it.
| 
| 3-done) Add a VoidPtrHandle.
| 
| 4-done) VoidPtrHandle should become ref-counting.
| 
| 5-done) MasterVoidPtr should become abstract, and we should use MasterIoPtr
|    as a concret subclass instead. Then we can dynamic_cast to/from
|    IO*'s, rather than static_cast'ing to/from void*. MasterVoidPtr
|    should not need the ptr() function anymore. 
| 
| 6-done) MasterVoidPtr can be renamed MasterPtrBase.
| 
| 7-done) We can remove destroyPtr() from the PtrList specification, since
|    the destruction of raw pointers can now be handled in the MasterPtr
|    hierarchy. 
| 
| 8-done) Make MasterIoPtr abstract and derive a template MasterPtr<T>
|    from it
| 
| 9-done) Move the ref-counting implementation into MasterPtrBase. Then
|    we can have different handle classes that are allowed to manage the
|    ref-counted objects. VoidPtrList can use VoidPtrHandle's, but
|    PtrList might use PtrHandle<T>.
| 
| 10-done) Add ItemWithId<T> that is basically a pair<int,SharedPtr>.
| 
| 11-done) Add isShared() to MasterPtrBase.
| 
| 12-done) Add the policy that VoidPtrList::remove() is not allowed unless the
|    object at that id is currently unshared. This should apply to
|    clear() as well.
| 
| 13-done) VoidPtrList can be renamed PtrListBase (!).
| 
| (very early) figure way for ObjList and PosList to notify Trials or
| Tlist when GrObj or Position is deleted. Then Trial should remove that
| (objid, posid) pair from its list. Possibility: have GrObj and
| Position implement a Notifier interface, where clients subscribe to
| the object, then the object has a notify() procedure that sends a
| message to each of its clients. Contents of message might be "I've
| changed" or "I'm destructed". Or... have ObjList control the
| notification since Trials only know about objids and posids. PtrList
| could maintain an array of info that is parallel to the stored
| pointers. This array could contain sets of clients for each id. Have
| to think carefully about how this structure could be maintained
| through serialization.
| 
| Or... do pseudo-smart pointer stuff within PtrList. Whenever some
| client is going to hold on to an id within the PtrList, it must "check
| out" the id. This would increment a reference count within the
| PtrList. Ptr's with a non-zero ref count are not allowed to be
| delete'd or overwritten. This is I guess just a simpler version of
| maintaining a list of clients--it doesn't allow for any messages to be
| sent back to the clients.
| 
| On third thought, this is a deep design issue. The question is, who
| owns the GrObj's and Position's? Who can delete them?
| 
| (19-Oct-1999) I'm suddenly turned off by PtrList's: 1) I just fixed a
| bug in insertAt that is equivalent to the 'check for assignment to
| self' in assignment operators, and 2) even worse, I just realized that
| it would be disastrous if the same pointer were stored at two
| locations in a PtrList... double deletion would result. This suggests
| to me that we need a more flexible and robust memory-management
| scheme, probably using reference-counted smart pointers. This will
| also eliminate a lot of "dangling id" problems that necessitated
| getCheckedPtr(id). But what sort of Tcl interface should the
| ref-counted smart-pointers have?
| 
| (24-Jan-2000) OK, forget the traditional ref-counted
| pointers. Instead, we'll put the reference counting right into the
| list. This will avoid the problems with maintaining the VoidPtrList <-
| IoPtrList <- PtrList hierarchy. VoidPtrList will be able to hold the
| ref counts, and maintain the ref counting logic; it will just have to
| forward object destruction to a derived class via a virtual function,
| as it does now.
| 
| Clients will use a ListItem, containing an integer id and a pointer to
| a PtrList. The ListItem's constructors and destructor will manage the
| ref counts via calls to PtrList member functions. ListItem will offer
| an operator-> so it can be used as a smart pointer.
| 
| In order to hide PtrList from clients, we can define the necessary
| functions out of line.
| 
| At the expense of some size, we can cache a C* inside ListItem so that
| we don't have to call a PtrList member function every time ListItem is
| used. Basically, PtrList would keep a counter that is incremented
| every time the list is modified. ListItems would maintain a const* to
| this count, and would also store the value of the counter from the
| last time their C* was cached. Then checking that the cache is current
| just involves dereferencing the const* counter and comparing it to the
| stored counter value.
| 
| Problem: how to handle derived classes with a ListItem?
| 
| (10-May-2000) In lieu of true reference counting with PtrList's, we
| could allow locks that clients could take that would temporarily
| prevent objects from being deleted.
| 
| (5-Oct-2000) What do I want out of an improved memory management
| system?
| 
|   *) be able to associate C++ objects with unique integers, and
|    retrieve the object from somewhere given the integer
|   *) ensure that the object is not destroyed until all references to
|    it and to its integer identifier are gone
|   *) provide some way for Tcl to control which objects are referenced
|    from Tcl and which are unreferenced... this probably requires a new
|    Tcl_Obj type
|   *) allow some of the conveniences of the current PtrList system,
|    like being able to retrieve a list of all valid objects of a given
|    type
| 
| Is the current system fatally flawed with respect to these goals? The
| hardest part is controlling references from Tcl.
| 
| One solution would just be to have the Tcl objects be typed, rather
| than just plain integers. The internal rep would be something that
| refers to the PtrList with an integer id, and disallows conversions to
| other Tcl_Obj types. However, then we wouldn't be able to do integer
| math with the id's, although we could view the id's as strings. This
| system requires a dependency on the Tcl ref-counting system.
| 
| Another solution would be to require explicit control of a Tcl
| reference count from the Tcl side, with functions like
| PtrList::incrRef and PtrList::decrRef. This might require us to have
| two ref counts, one for the C++ side and one for the Tcl side, in
| order to keep things safe and sensible.
| 
| ... I think the first option is more sound, although it is a bit less
| convenient in the sense that it will require some changes to existing
| scripts. If I had itcl up and running, I could build an equally safe
| solution out of itcl code using the second implementation.
| 
| ... I tried a bit at implementing the first option, playing around
| with a new Tcl_ObjType. It seems like I don't have a good way to
| control exactly when objects are ref'd, unref'd, and when they switch
| types. So, I think I'm going to try for option two for now, by added
| two reference counts to the PtrList's, one for C++ and one for
| Tcl. Tcl scripts will have to manually control the reference counts
| for now.
| 
| ... Need to focus on getting more behavior into the smart pointers,
| and less in the PtrList. The PtrList has two functions: one is to
| control how id's are doled out, and the other is to maintain knowledge
| of all existing pointers of a certain type.

(19-Jan-2000, done 5-Oct-2000) Auto-detect gzipped files? This is done
for the stringifycmd module.

(16-Sep-1999, fixed) BUG: if somehow the current trial becomes
invalid, it is impossible to show a new trial because the program
always tries to undraw the current, invalid trial before drawing a new
one. So there is no way to un-corrupt the program state.

(9-Oct-2000, done 11-Oct-2000) Could refactor EventResponseHdlr and
Trial by using a state pattern instead of an enum TrialState. Done for
EventResponseHdlr, but I'm not sure this helped make things clearer.

(28-Jun-1999, done 11-Oct-2000) Need way for TclCmd's to "own"
TclEvalCmd's, so that the Tcl_Interp* management can be hidden from
the client. [Later] OK, this is done fairly well by Tcl::Interp and
Tcl::Code.

(done 16-Oct-2000) NullablePtrHandle? Allows resources to be
purged. Done. 

(note 18-Oct-2000) Ouch! I got bitten by a bug (? or my own problem) using
MIPSpro. The call was
   C& p = dynamic_cast<C&>(*(itsList.getCheckedPtr(id)));
in AbstractListItemPkg<C,List>::getCItemFromId(). The problem was that
if the dynamic_cast threw an exception, the temporary SharedPtr
created by getCheckedPtr() was not destroyed properly, meaning that
the reference-counts got hosed. This is a Bad Thing. Who's right?
Is the temporary supposed to be destroyed, or not? ... the standard
says the temporary must be destroyed... maybe this was a bad
interaction of virtual functions, templates, temporaries, exceptions,
etc. in MIPSpro.

| Migrate legacy data 18-Oct-2000
| done 20-Oct-2000
| 
| Should get rid of legacySrlz and legacyDesrlz once and for all.
| 
| 1-done) fMRI data -- These are not likely to ever be needed. But... I was
|    able to successfully convert all of this data to ASW format.
| 
| 2-done) Psychophysics fall 1999 -- These are readable by the current
|    legacyDesrlz. Therefore, we can migrate these files to
|    AsciiStreamWriter format in a batch process.
| 
| 	human_ac human_em human_jl human_ne human_rl
| 	also human_ok human_rp human_fg
| 
| 3-done) Psychophysics spring 1999 -- These are not readable by the current
| 	legacyDesrlz, and have fundamental incompatibility due to the lack
| 	of RhList, ThList, BlockList. Therefore, I think it's best to
| 	orphan them right now. The file format is fairly straightforward if
| 	I needed to pull the data out at somepoint in the future. These
| 	files are also readable+writable by grsh.a1.2.2, grsh0.5a2, and
| 	grsh0.5a3. I'll freeze grsh0.8a2 as is, so that I could in
| 	principle restructure these files at some point to be readable by
| 	grsh0.8a2, and then re-write them in ASW format.
| 
| 	human_ap human_aw human_cc human_ss
| 
| 4-done) Copy all legacyDesrlz/legacySrlz functions into a text document as
| 	a quick way to be able to manually read older files.
| 
| 5-done) The object definition files in faces_triads/. Do we continue
|    to support this format, or convert these to ASW somehow? Or define
|    a "new" format for GrObj's only that allows them to be read in a
|    similar way? Probably best to have a new format that is similar to
|    the sparse format now used by LegacyReader. The question is, should
|    the new format be implemented with readTo/writeFrom, or does it
|    require a separate interface? Probably we can use readTo/writeFrom,
|    especially since, this should be used mostly for GrObj's... this
|    would allow us to collapse legacySrlz and legacyDesrlz back into
|    readFrom/writeTo, since we wouldn't be trying to support an old
|    format anymore. OK, the new format for LegacyWriter is stabilized,
|    so I can go ahead and convert all of the object definition
|    files. Done. Also, I now have testall.tcl file in the faces_triads
|    directory that will use any version of grsh to make sure that all
|    the files are readable.
| 
| Ahhh... this is good. I've released the grip that the legacy IO format
| held over this project. So far it has cut out nearly 2000 lines of
| source code... I expect I may find more in the future as well.
| 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------

(note 18-Oct-2000) I need to think a lot more carefully in the future
if/when changing file formats. As a one-user system, I think it is
reasonable to consider migrating all old data over to a new format
rather than trying to support multiple formats. Hopefully this is less
of a problem with ASW format than with the Legacy format. I need to
add a bunch of test cases that ensure that various old files
(e.g. from psychophysics, fMRI) are still readable with each version.

(3-Jul-1999, done 24-Oct-2000) Tlist makeSingles, etc. could now take
a sequence/list of objids as an optional argument utilizing
TclCmd::getSequenceFromArg.

(note 25-Oct-2000) Note to self. std::map is not actually such a slow
compiler, as long as neither of the types is std::string... only takes
10-15 sec to compile a file std::map, even if one of the types is not
a builtin.

(25-Oct-2000, done 26-Oct-2000) Try overloading operator new+delete in
IoObject. OK, tried this, and found with profiling that these are
definitely *NOT* a bottleneck. Combined, they took about 0.1% of the
runtime in a test-suite run.

========================================================================
| Resource management revisited 17-Oct-2000
| done 27-Oct-2000
| 
| (1-done) Generalize Factory so it can take a creation function. Make
|     class constructors protected and add make() creation functions
|     instead.
| 
| (2-done) Aha! We can get rid of MasterPtr.... IoObject itself should
|     handle the reference counting. Then PtrHandle<T> of different
|     types can be assigned to each other, DynamicCast'ed, etc., since
|     the pointee's (IoObject*'s) will be related through inheritance.
| 
|     In detail
|     (done) MasterPtrBase becomes RefCounted
|     (done) IoObject inherits from RefCounted
|     (done) VoidPtrHandle manages RefCounted
|     (done) PtrListBase manages RefCounted
|     (done) PtrHandle<T> holds T* (derived from RefCounted) directly
|     (done) NullablePtrHandle<T> holds T* directly
|     (done) get rid of masterptrt.cc
| 
| (3-done) Make sure nobody is writing PtrList ids in writeTo().
|     (done) Block
|     (done) Trial ... this is tricky. Need to refactor the implementation
| 		  to store two vectors of GrObj's and Position's, I think. Only
| 		  client of beginIdPairs() is TlistUtils::writeMatlab(). That
| 		  can change to use an iterator over the GrObj's instead. Will
| 		  need to have a dummy IdPairSpoofer structure in the
| 		  implementation to allow us to read older files.
| 	 (done) ExptDriver
| 
| (4-done) Migrate all old experiment data-files over to this new format
|     that will not include PtrList's. I'll make a snapshot of the
|     system so that we can get back to the state that can convert
|     between old+new format. Then I'll rev the project version and cut
|     out the old format code so that the IO code doesn't get too messy.
| 
| (5-done) Make sure there is a snapshot of the project that can read
|     old files (i.e. with PtrList's) but also write new files (w/o
|     PtrList's). OK, this is grsh0.8a3.
| 
| (6-done) Make the IoMap. When an IoObject is constructed, we put its
|     id+address into the map, and when it is destroyed, we remove it
|     from the map. We need functions to iterate through the map, to
|     test if an id is valid, to return the count of objects.
| 
| (7-done) A key step here is eliminating uses of insertAt(). The main
| 	 perpetrator here is TlistUtils, whose interface needs a major
| 	 overhaul.
| 
| (8-done) Make all PtrListBase functions virtual, so we can try swapping
|     implementations at the PtrList<T> level.
| 
| (9-done) For debugging purposes, add a second ref-count to RefCounted,
| 	 so that Tcl clients can manipulate a separate reference count.
| 
| (10-done) An important intermediate goal is the state where the PtrList's
|     are still physically in place, but all of the id's in existence
|     are just the plain IoId's. ... Maybe this is not really a useful
|     stage. I think once we are at the point where this stage is
|     feasible, we'll just be wanting to finally ditch the PtrList's.
| 
| (11-done) Make the C++ side independent of PtrList's. Block's need to store
|     Trial*'s (or ItemWithId<TrialBase>'s), and ExptDriver needs to
|     store ItemWithId<Block>'s.
| 
|     (done) block.cc      on tlist.h
|     (done) exptdriver.cc on blocklist.h
|     (done) eventresponsehdlr.cc on soundlist.h
| 
|     (done) tlistutils.cc on objlist.h
|     (done) tlistutils.cc on poslist.h
| 
| (12-done) Fix the read/write system so we don't have to work with
| 	 temporary containers when reading/writing member containers. Done
| 	 -- added WriteUtils::writeSmartPtrSeq, and added special insert
| 	 iterators for IdItem and MaybeIdItem that can work with
| 	 ReadUtils::readObjectSeq
| 
| (13-done) Ditch the itsId member of IdItem, since it would always be
| 	 the same as itsHandle->id(). MaybeIdItem needs to keep itsId,
| 	 since this is what allows us to implement lazy fetching.
| 
| (14-done) Try to eliminate uses of MaybeIdItem in favor of
| 	 IdItem. ... Yeahbut, in some cases we need to have some way to
| 	 represent "no object". It's either this way, or generate
| 	 NullObject classes for each base type that can fill in for a real
| 	 object... this sounds more messy. In some cases I should be able
| 	 to get rid of MaybeIdItem.
| 
| (15-done) We might be able to do away PtrList templates, in favor
| 	 of one gigantic IoPtrList that stores everybody... with the new id
| 	 system, there would be no id collision problem, and since most
| 	 retrievals from a PtrList require a dynamic_cast anyway, there
| 	 wouldn't be an extra performance hit for casting out of the
| 	 IoPtrList. Then we could have IdItem's referring not just to the
| 	 base-classes (i.e. GrObj, Position, TrialBase, etc.) but also to
| 	 derived classes (e.g. Face, FixPt, Trial, etc.). What's the
| 	 simplest possible step toward trying this? Maybe make
| 	 getCheckedPtr() a member template function, so we can start
| 	 specifying the type we're trying to retrieve. We'd need to have
| 	 templated iterator types to provide different views of the
| 	 IoPtrList. This could be a fairly simple template wrapper around
| 	 the basic iterator.
| 
| (22-Oct-2000) I see the elimination of PtrList's in the
| future. Instead we can maintain a map of ioId()'s to IoObject*'s. This
| can be managed in the constructor+destructor for IoObject. This map
| could be purged of refcount-0 objects on command. The map would allow
| us to do similar operations to what the PtrList's provide now. For
| example, find all objects of a given type.
| 
| (done, 18-Oct-2000) Aha! I have a vision... the PtrList's do not need
| to be serialized at all... they can become merely a runtime resource
| that expose C++ objects to Tcl. This will be possible if C++ objects
| serialize not object-id's, but rather actual object references. Then
| the id's will be automatically reconstructed when the objects are read
| back in.
| 
| (done, 17-Oct-2000) Move ItemWithId<T> and NullableItemWithId<T> off
| into their own component. Most C++ clients should not have to rely on
| PtrList directly, or access any of the singletons.
| 
| (done, 17-Oct-2000) Make C++ clients of getPtr() and getCheckedPtr()
| just store an ItemWithId<T> instead.
| 
| (done 17-Oct-2000) ItemWithId<T> could store a static PtrList<T>&,
| which would allow us to construct an ItemWithId<T> from a MasterPtr
| only, and insert this MasterPtr into the PtrList from within the
| ItemWithId structure. Done.
| 
| (done 17-Oct-2000) Make PtrList::insert() functions return an
| ItemWithId. This is a first step to eliminating reliance on the int
| id's in the C++ side of things. Done.
| 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------

(8-Jan-2000, done 27-Oct-2000) How to read/write CountedPtr's? This is
the big barrier to establishing CountedPtr's as a better way to manage
objects between C++ and Tcl. Probably Reader/Writer need a special
method for CountedPtr's. The question is how to keep track of the
pointers to the reference counts. Or... we could put the reference
count right in IO... Aha! Instead of AsciiStreamReader maintaining a
map<unsigned long, IO*> during deserialization, we could use a
map<unsigned long, CountedPtr<IO> >. However, this introduces a split
from the semantics of readOwnedObject()... this suggests that we need
a separate map for owned objects. As this transition will require a
nearly universal switch to CountedPtr's, we need to provide a feasible
migration route, perhaps by providing the ability to short-circuit
CountedPtr's ref-counting at first. ... This is not an issue
anymore. Now IoObjects have a built in ref-count. Reader+Writer don't
explicitly do anything with the refcount; instead, clients are
responsible for grabbing the object if they need it.

(10-Oct-2000, done 27-Oct-2000) Start reaping the benefits of my
PtrList ref-counting refactoring by allowing clients to lock onto
their resources using ItemWithId<T>. Done.

(10-Oct-2000, done 27-Oct-2000) PtrList could do an "idiot check" on
insert to make sure that we aren't storing the same pointer in two
slots. If this happens with the same MasterPtr, we can just return the
previous MasterPtr; however if it happens with two MasterPtr's
pointing to the same object, then it is a bug which will result in
memory corruption.

(done 30-Oct-2000) iditem.h --> io/iditem.h & io/iditemutils.h

(done 30-Oct-2000) ioptrlist.h+cc --> io/ioptrlist.h+cc

(done 30-Oct-2000) Remove List template argument from ListItemPkg.

(done 30-Oct-2000) Replace DefaultCreatorCmd with a single IO::new
that uses IoFactory. Turn List::remove into IO::delete.

(nix 30-Oct-2000, 24-Jun-1999) Would be nice to define some sort of
appropriate inheritance semantics for CTclPkg's... so that CTclPkg<B>
can inherit from CTclPkg<A> iff B inherits from A, and furthermore
that this inheritance does "all the right things".

(nix 30-Oct-2000, 30-Jun-1999) Really need to get an iterator working
for PtrList's... and get rid of these pseudo-working Id's. OK, now
have an iterator class implemented, but how to construct them?
Specifically, I'll need to be able to construct iterators from int
id's, but then what to do if the int is an invalid index? Throw an
exception? Leave the iterator in a corrupted state? Also, basically
all of the PtrList operations should use iterators... addPtr() should
return an iterator, remove() should take an iterator.

(nix 30-Oct-2000, 6-Oct-1999) Should Property's be Observable's? Is
this worth the extra space? Perhaps only some properties should be
Observable's. How would this be done?

(nix 30-Oct-2000, 22-Nov-1999) Hey, I think I might be able to totally
do away with PtrList's, at least in the public interface. I think that
they could be wrapped into the base class, so that every GrObj created
is automatically placed in the ObjList, and anytime a GrObj is
destroyed it is removed from the PtrList. This would just entail
overriding operator new + delete for that class. The class would have
static operations that mimic the PtrList's operations.

(done 30-Oct-2000, 1-Dec-1999) Unsavory dependencies:
  EventResponseHdlr on ObjTogl -- axed via Widget abstraction!
  EventResponseHdlr on SoundList
  ObjTogl on Tlist -- compilation dep gone, but still link dep
  Trial on ObjList, PosList?
  Block on Tlist?
  BitmapRep on GLCanvas::theCanvas()

... I see that this whole PtrList business introduces some wacky
  dependencies... I don't think C++ clients should be depending on the
  PtrList's directly. Instead, maybe the PtrList's should manage
  CountedPtr's or something similar, so that the integer indices are
  only visible in Tcl. [Later 30-Oct-2000] With the whole IoPtrList
  refactoring, we have now eliminated C++ client's dependencies on the
  item ids.

(nix 30-Oct-2000) Goal: ExptDriver shouldn't have to know about any
lists except maybe BlockList. As for serializing, the lists should
register themselves with ExptDriver at application startup. Experiment
base class should declare an abstract manageObject(const char* name,
IO* object) function. The lists should call this in in their
Tcl_PkgInitProc's. The problem with this approach is that we lose the
ability to control the order in which the lists are read/written
through the IO interface. This is not so much a problem for the
readFrom()/writeTo() interface, as this is designed to be
order-independent, but it is a problem for the
serialize()/deserialize() interface. Perhaps we could use some ad hoc
strategy to make sure that the managed objects are written in the same
order every time (based on their ioTypename() for instance?). [Later]
This is obsolete since we no longer depend on PtrList's in the
serialization process.

(done 1-Nov-2000) Got rid of all the unneeded io tcl commands... we
don't need a separate stringify/destringify command for each subclass;
instead, a single one in the IO:: tcl namespace will do just
fine. This allowed us to get rid of TclIoItemPkg in favor of an
addIoCommands() function in TclItemPkg, taking an IoFetcher* as an
argument. This in turn allowed us to get rid of CTclIoItemPkg and the
duplication that existed between it and CTclItemPkg.

(3-Dec-1999, done 2-Nov-2000) I have a potential type-system loophole
with TclItemPkg and TclItemCmd... TclItemPkg blindly casts
TclItemCmd::getItemFromId() from void* to T*, without any guarantee
that TclItemPkg is dealing with the correct type. Suggests we need a
template wrapper around TclItemPkg? No... we can fix this by just
having TclItemCmd<C> require a CTclItemPkg<C> in its constructor
rather than a plain TclItemPkg.

(24-Oct-2000, done 3-Nov-2000) Work on dlink_list... it's buggy. I
think it needs an overhaul of the design of the head and
tail... having these starting off at 0 is not working. OK, I did this,
but it is still not working if I try to substitute dlink_list in
gxtraversal.cc. ... OK, now I found this new problem -- it's with
node::destroy(). If T was a pointer type (say, GxNode*), then calling
val.~T() was causing the actual GxNode to be destroyed, not just the
pointer to it. This seems to have been resolved by changing the call
to (&val)->~T(). I tried substituting dlink_list everywhere slink_list
was being used, and things still worked fine, so I think I'm going to
sign off on dlink_list as passing muster for now.

| done 28-Nov-2000
| 
| This is done, with possibilities for future development by way of
| implementing new GxNode subclasses, such as for colors, basic shapes, etc.
| 
| (24-Jan-2000) Allow a more flexible description of the scene graph, a
| la Open Inventor.
| 
| This is now particularly important as Trial's take on more
| behavior... they shouldn't be used anymore as a way to store
| combinations of objects.
| 
| (1-Nov-2000) borrowed from OpenInventor --
| 
| class GxNode : public IO::IoObject {};

|  |
|  +-- class GxGroup : public GxNode {};
|       |
|       +-- class GxSeparator : public GxGroup {};
| 
| Then Trial just holds one IdItem<GxNode>, and draws it on a
| DrawEvent. Or, Trial holds a number of IdItem<GxNode>'s, and DrawEvent
| holds an index indicating which one to draw.
| 
| This is probably an incompatible change with the old Trial... or maybe
| not... we should be able to convert old Trial structures into new Gx
| hierarchies. And the old add() interface should still work, with a bit
| of translation.
| 
| (1-done) Put GxNode in place.
| 
| (2-done) Make GrObj derive from GxNode.
| 
| (3-done) Find former clients of GrObj who really only need to depend on

| 
| (4-done) Make Position derive from GxNode.
|

| 
| (7-done) getCategory() --> category()
| 
| (8-done) Reimplement Trial using GxNode's instead of GrObj's and
|     Position's.
| 
| (9-done) Add FieldContainer. Where to put this in the inheritance
|     hierarchy? Right now it is just a mixin class... eventually it
|     could go before GrObj or even GxNode... this would require a
|     coherent policy on how to handle inherited Field's.
| 
| (10-done) Change the semantics of Trial so that only one GxNode is
|     drawn at a time... in the future we might allow different GxNode's
|     to be drawn on subsequent calls to trDraw().
| 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(1-Nov-2000, done 28-Nov-2000) Make PropertyContainer or
FieldContainer a base class; then Property's can be handled through
inheritance rather than by templates. This should reduce some code
bloat.

| Goal #4

| 
| (24-Jan-2000) Develop a more coherent view of the screen-update model:
| Who gets to do it, and when?
| 
| (28-Nov-2000) Aha! TlistWidget should change to be a GxNodeWidget,
| which stores a current GxNode to be drawn. Then Trial, in trDraw() and
| trUndraw(), can install the appropriate GxNode into the widget, and
| then request a draw or an undraw; Trial will not have to do any
| drawing/undrawing explicitly on its own. I think this would make
| GxNodeWidget the only place where the drawing is actually done in the
| application.
| 
| (done) GxNodeWidget functionality should just go into the Widget base
| class with the function setDrawable(GxNode& node).
| 
| (done) remove Block::drawTrialHook() and Experiment::edSetCurrentTrial().
| 
| (done) trUndrawTrial is not needed, since we can just call
| widget.undraw(). This would apply to UndrawEvent::invoke() as well as
| trHaltExpt(). This would mean Trial would need to store a GWT::Widget*
| rather than a GWT::Canvas*.
| 
| (done) Aha! trDraw is not needed either, since we can just
| trial.installSelf(widget) followed by widget.display()
| 
| (done) ToglConfig::reconfigure() should be non-virtual and private.
| 
| (2-Oct-2000) The first step in this is to eliminate any direct
| attempts to draw to the screen, other than by a Widget object (such as
| TlistWidget). Others who want the screen updated should do so
| indirectly by requesting the widget to redraw itself.

(2-Oct-1999, done 15-Nov-2000) Should be able to call up a property
info struct from a class by giving it a string name of a
property. [Later] This is done now with FieldMap, which can be gotten
from a class by the static function classFields(), and which has a
member info() that retrieves a FieldInfo object given the attribute
name.

(28-Nov-2000, done 28-Nov-2000) Make Position use Vec3's. Move
translate(), scale(), and rotate() into Canvas, along with appropriate
Vec3 arguments.

(27-Oct-2000, done 30-Nov-2000) Should IoPtrList attempt to get
objects out of the IoMap if the PtrList site is empty? No--some
objects need to remain permanently hidden as implementation details.

========================================================================
| "Dynamic templates" 4-Oct-2000
| 
| (4-Oct-2000) I like the idea I saw in the CUJ that dealt with
| deferring the template nature of something. Basically a generic
| interface is provided in a derived class, like
| 
| class Impl { public: virtual ~class Impl(); };
| 
| template <class T> class TImpl : public Impl { public: T data; };
| 
| class Interface {
| public:
|   template <class T>
|   T getT() {
|     TImpl* tptr = dynamic_cast<TImpl<T>*>(itsImpl);
|     if (tptr) return tptr->data;
|     else { throw "..."; }
|   }
| 
|   Impl* itsImpl;
| };
| 
| This allows Interface to gain some of the benefits of templates, but
| doesn't require the entire class to be templated, only the getT()
| function. If there a long chain of templates involved, this technique
| might be able to defer the templated-ness to the last class in the
| chain, for example. This is a particular benefit if there are virtual
| functions involved, since it allows us to avoid having vtables laid
| down everywhere.
| 
| As a practice before I move on to a more heavy use of this approach, I
| bet I can use this approach to eliminate the use of void*'s in the
| implentation of the TclPkg hierarchy. Ugh. I just realized that this
| is basically skirting around the idea of just using a
| mother-of-all-base classes approach, such as deriving everything from
| Object. The template idea is just a way of grafting on the MOAB to a
| preexisting object hierarchy. ... except that the template approach
| does allow non-objects to be included, such as native types,
| pointer-to-members, etc.
| 
| I think I should be able to get some benefit of this in my TclPkg
| hierarchy. For example, PropertyInfo would not have to be a template
| class; instead, PropertyInfo::property() would just have to be a
| template member function, along with a template constructor.
| 
| *) Turning PropertyInfo into a non-template class allows us to turn
|    the get getPropertyInfos() interface from an ad-hoc interface to a
|    dynamic, polymorphic interface.
| 
| *) PropFriend would have an non-template base class that would define
|    the functions set() and get(). These would be implemented in a
|    template class that used dynamic casts to get the type information
|    back out.
| 
| *) CPropertiesCmd would not have to be a template.
| 
| (30-Nov-2000) Time to move on... I don't think this technique will be
| too useful for me; the one possible area of use might be as a way to
| implement generic function pointers.
| 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(2-Oct-1999, nixed 30-Nov-2000) Property's could store a pointer to
something like ValChecker, which has a virtual function, that could
variously do 1) check whether new value is the same as the current
value, 2) check whether the new value is in bounds/valid. If the
ValChecker* is 0, then no check is done, and not much time is lost
worrying about the check. This would avoid the problem of trying to
maintain parallel hierarchies of Property, BoundedProperty, etc.

(1-Dec-2000, done 2-Dec-2000) Need a better naming convention to
distinguish between unadorned value types (like Vec3), field/value
types (like GxVec3), and scene node types.

OK, I'll use no prefix for unadorned basic types, use the prefix 'Gb'
for Field/Value types, and use 'Gx' for scene nodes.

RgbaColor (unadorned) ---> GbRgbaColor (Field/Value) ---> GxRgbaColor (node)

Vec3 (unadorned) ---> GbVec3 (Field/Value)

(30-Oct-2000, done 2-Dec-2000) Use PtrHandle's in TimingHdlr
implementation to avoid deleteAll().

(22-Mar-2000) We could have a more compact reader/writer format by
using a system that wrote class definitions to the file, and stored
some sort of translator for each class in the reader/writer... this
would allow us to just store the raw data for individual objects,
without having to store the metadata over and over. [Later] the
generic version of this is that each read/write requires a per-class
translater, with the default being that the normal verbose translater
is used, but if a different translater is present, then that one can
be used instead. This idea might come around if I implement
FormatWriter as suggested in a different note.

(May-1999, obsolete 5-Dec-2000) An idea for a more generic way to
describe Trial's: rather than explicitly storing objid/posid pairs,
Trial's could store sequences of events (this overlaps my previous
idea about using events to describe trial timing). One particular
*type* of event then could be DisplayObjectAtPosition (or something
less wordy). This event would store the objid and posid (or maybe
GrObj* and Position*) and would know how to display itself. The events
would have in common an action() function or something
similar. Problem: who stores the references to ObjList and PosList
that make posid's and objid's work?  Currently it is Trial's, but with
this new scheme there would have to be one for each
DisplayObjectAtPosition event, and with several of these per Trial,
and perhaps thousands of Trials in an Expt, this means many thousands
of references, all of which are pointing at just one or two
ObjList's/PosList's. This seems somewhat excessive. What to do ...?
[Later] This latter problem has been solved by making ObjList and
PosList singletons.

(22-Jun-1999, done) Ugh. Spent all day tracking down idiotic pointer
problems. Should really use vector<unsigned char> rather than C-style
arrays to hold the info in Bitmap's and Pbm's, and use checked access
through at() especially when algorithms are untested.

(May-1999, obsolete 6-Dec-2000) Trial's should hold more info-- in
particular, they should know their own correct response, or at least
have a virtual function to determine if a particular response is
correct/valid or not. The derived classes could be "BinaryTrial",
"AnalogTrial", etc. This would avoid having to implement the
feedback/correctness check at a high level. Also, Trial's might know
their own timing info, although they may not necessarily implement the
timing themselves.

(14-Dec-1999, obsolete 11-Dec-2000) The implementation of GrObj should
be moved into a separate component since it is fairly
heavyweight. Subclasses would then be required to provide this
implementation upon construction. This method would allow clients, but
not subclasses, of GrObj to avoid dependencies on such components as
bitmaprep, etc. But, how to avoid having to make all GrObj functions
virtual? We'd like some to stay non-virtual. Aha! The new lightweight
GrObj shouldn't even have the grRender(), grUnRender(), or
grGetBoundingBox() functions... these will first be defined in
GrObjImpl. [Later] ... ok, this is moot now because of the addition of
GxNode, which is a lightweight abstract class that serves the needs of
most clients.

| (29-Oct-2000, tabled 11-Dec-2000) We could make a lot of IoPtrList Tcl
| commands very generic, by allowing a predicate argument to determine
| which objects are to be acted upon. See batch.tcl. This could be
| called IoDb::batch. ... I'll table this idea for now; most of this can
| be more simply done by creating the relevant commands in each
| IoItemPkg (such as removeAll, countAll, findAll).
| 
| (9-Dec-2000, done 11-Dec-2000) Replace all of the PtrList Tcl packages
| with a few commands that are added to each ItemPkg... these include
| findAll, countAll, removeAll. ObjList::save/loadObjects should move to
| IoDb.
| 
| (1-Nov-2000, done 11-Dec-2000) IoPtrList --> IoDb.
| 
| (29-Oct-2000, done 11-Dec-2000) ObjList::LoadObjectCmd can be replaced
| with something generic that works for all IoObject types. Maybe these
| should go in ReadUtils/WriteUtils? Templated on the Reader/Writer
| type? OK, this stuff is in the IoDb package now.
| 
| (27-Oct-2000, done 11-Dec-2000) Do we still need separate Tcl packages
| for the different PtrList's? I think no. We should be able to have a
| single IoDb:: namespace in Tcl.

+-----

(May-1999, obsolete 11-Dec-2000) Maybe Position should be migrated to
an abstract base class, with the current Position class becoming
StaticPosition or FixedPosition. What would a Position subclass for
moving objects look like? This is mooted by the presence GxNode.

(28-Sep-2000, nix 13-Dec-2000) fixed_block and dynamic_block should
have release() members, so that we can use them for exception-safe
storage, then transfer ownership of the buffer to someone else once
the operations are safely completed. ... [Later] Forget this, since if
someone else wants ownership, they should just use a fixed_block or
dynamic_block themselves.
