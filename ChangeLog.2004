  [DONE] remove util/hash.h (not used anywhere)
  [DONE] remove util/slink_list.h (use autoconf test for #include <ext/slist> and __gnu_cxx::slist<> instead)

* (25-Nov-2002, done 2-Aug-2004) What is GWT::Widget's raison d'etre?

  OK, now I've got Widget cleaned out. But... now, what's its reason to
  exist? It barely has any abstract interface. Basically it's serving as a
  glorified mult-arg Signal.

  OK, eliminated GWT::Widget by rolling it into Tcl::TkWidget.
