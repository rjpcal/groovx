* Rob Peters <rjpeters at klab dot caltech dot edu>

* (17-Jul-2004, done 19-Jul-2004) Clean according to the way of UNIX!

  [DONE] remove util/dlink_list.h (not used anywhere in project)
  [DONE] remove util/hash.h (not used anywhere)
  [DONE] remove util/slink_list.h (use autoconf test for #include <ext/slist> and __gnu_cxx::slist<> instead)
  [DONE] remove util/randutils.h (use util/rand.h instead)

* (25-Nov-2002, done 2-Aug-2004) What is GWT::Widget's raison d'etre?

  OK, now I've got Widget cleaned out. But... now, what's its reason to
  exist? It barely has any abstract interface. Basically it's serving as a
  glorified mult-arg Signal.

  OK, eliminated GWT::Widget by rolling it into Tcl::TkWidget.

* (2-Jul-2002, done) new project name?

   OO framework

     hood
     loot
     ooze
     poof
     igloo
     roost
     scoop
     troop
     cooler
     noodle

   Psychophysics experiments -- groovx groovx groovx -- is this "the
   one"? yep

* (22-Nov-1999, canceled) Need to get rjp_subject working.
  1) Need to maintain a do_expt script in each subject's directory. 2)
  Need to make sure that autosave file is writable by rjp_subject, and
  if not, use a different filename. (Maybe use temp filename
  generating facility of OS?). Canceled... rjp_subject doesn't even
  exist anymore...
